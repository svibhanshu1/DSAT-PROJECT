    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the task is to create an ATM machine program which performs tasks of  depositing some amount, withdrawing some amount, transferring funds and checking account balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "    The concepts of Object-oriented Programming(OOP) are used to achieve the end goal. \n",
    "    OOP mainly uses the idea of classes and objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are classes in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Classes can be defined as a user-defined data type. A class contains some attributes and methods. \n",
    "    Attributes can be called as the properties of the data type we are creating using a class. \n",
    "    A method is mainly a function which defines the behavior of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are objects in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    An object is an instance of a class. It is a real world entity which has unique attributes and behavior.\n",
    "    An object can also be called as an entity of type 'class'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the ATM machine program, the saving balance and checking balance attributes have been initialized inside the constructor with a default value . The pin remains private as it is known only by the user. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Separate methods for checking account balance, depositing, withdrawing and transferring have been created and have been accessed at appropriate times . \n",
    "\n"
